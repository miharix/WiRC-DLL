When I was testing "Change Configuration" this configuration made me "litle" worried:

SSID = Dension WiRC
Is WPA = checked
Is Accespoint = checked
Password = "1234"
Country code = "SI"

the transmitter did't show on WiFi list, trying to flash using 8G FAT32 didn't worked, the LED was flashing more than 2 hours (The WiRC was on regulated Power Supply), later the USB contained some random? generated but corupted more than 1G file
Flashing using 8G FAT (FAT16) was the same result
Finaly flashing using some old 256Mb USB fomated to FAT16 fixed the WiRC
